When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Having the work online, helps in easy access from anywhere rather than being limited only to local workstation

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Sometimes we might use GitHub to check or update temporary changes before bringing them to our local base. So I think in those case we might prefer manual pulling.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are when we want our own version of someone else's repository, clone is copying an exisiting repository to our local computer and branches is creating a seperate branch in any existing repository for like to keep it seperate from the master branch, so that, we can work on our branch seperately and it does not affect the master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
The local copy of the last known state helps us to know the status and difference between the state in github and the state locally. It helps us to keep in check our changes on both and is thus necessary and useful.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
The only we way we could collaborate without Github is if we knew the someone personally, because we'd be have to be in constant contact with them over what changes to make or not. So that will be hard. Don't think anything will be easier without Git and Github.
