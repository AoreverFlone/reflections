When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Having the work online, helps in easy access from anywhere rather than being limited only to local workstation

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Sometimes we might use GitHub to check or update temporary changes before bringing them to our local base. So I think in those case we might prefer manual pulling.
